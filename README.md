## 🧪 Our Testing Philosophy

**"Test small, fail fast, scale what works"**

We believe in:
- Starting with MVPs (Minimum Viable Products)
- Getting real feedback from real businesses
- Iterating based on actual results, not assumptions
- Building long-term relationships, not quick transactions
- Transparency about what we're learning

## 🎯 Ideal Early Partners

You might be perfect for our testing phase if you:
- Run a small business (1-50 employees)
- Have some budget for marketing ($500-$5,000/month)
- Are open to trying new approaches
- Can provide honest feedback
- Want to grow but don't know where to start
- Are located in Northeast Ohio (preferred but not required)

## 📈 What's Next

As we validate our services, we're building towards:
- **Specialized packages** for each proven niche
- **Automation templates** for common business workflows
- **Industry-specific marketing playbooks**
- **Partnership network** with complementary services
- **Educational content** based on real results

## 💡 Why This Approach?

Instead of claiming to be experts at everything, we're:
- Honestly testing what works
- Building expertise through real implementation
- Creating case studies with actual data
- Developing services based on client needs, not assumptions
- Keeping prices low while we learn together
