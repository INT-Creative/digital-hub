```

### Day 3: Check-In
```
Subject: Quick question about the proposal

Hi [Name],

I wanted to make sure the proposal made it through okay and see if any initial questions came up.

The [specific opportunity mentioned] is still available if we can start by [date].

Happy to jump on a quick call: [Calendar link]
```

### Day 7: Value Add
```
Subject: Thought this might help

Hi [Name],

While you're considering the proposal, I thought this might be useful:

[Link to relevant case study or resource]

This shows how [similar business] achieved [specific result].

Still happy to discuss whenever you're ready.
```

### Day 14: Final Follow-Up
```
Subject: Should I close your file?

Hi [Name],

I haven't heard back about the proposal and want to be respectful of your time.

Should I close your file for now, or is there something specific holding you back that I could address?

If timing isn't right, no worries - I'll check back in a few months.

Either way, the free audit and recommendations are yours to keep.
```

## Objection Handling Scripts

### "It's too expensive"
"I understand price is important. Let me ask - if you do nothing, what will it cost you in lost customers over the next year? Our clients typically see returns of 3-5x their investment. Would it help to start with our Foundation package and scale up?"

### "I need to think about it"
"Of course! What specific aspects would be most helpful to think through? I find most clients want to know about [common concern]. Would it help if I provided [specific information/reference]?"

### "I need to talk to my partner/team"
"That makes perfect sense. Would it be helpful if I joined that conversation to answer technical questions? I can also provide a one-page summary highlighting the ROI projections for their review."

### "We're too busy right now"
"I hear that a lot, and it's exactly why our done-for-you approach works. We handle everything while you focus on your business. Most clients spend less than 1 hour per week with us. Would starting in [future month] work better?"
