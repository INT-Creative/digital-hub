### DALL-E 3 Version
```
Create a professional photograph of a modern, responsive website displayed on multiple Apple devices (27-inch iMac, iPad Pro, iPhone 14) arranged on a clean white standing desk. The website shows a forest green (#0B3D2E) and sage green (#A8BFA3) color scheme with clean, modern design. Small potted succulent plant and minimalist coffee cup placed for scale. Bright, natural lighting from large window on the left creating soft shadows. In the background, slightly out of focus, the Cleveland, Ohio skyline is visible through floor-to-ceiling windows, suggesting a modern Northeast Ohio office space. The overall composition should feel professional yet approachable, with the devices taking up 70% of the frame. Photorealistic style, high-end business photography, 16:9 aspect ratio, 4K resolution quality.
