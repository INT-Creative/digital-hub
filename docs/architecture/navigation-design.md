# Navigation Design Architecture

## Overview
The navigation system implements a professional dropdown approach that showcases services with descriptions and pricing while maintaining mobile accessibility through touch-friendly accordion interactions.

## Desktop Navigation
- **Hover activation**: Dropdown appears on mouse hover
- **Service cards**: Each service displays title, description, and pricing
- **Visual hierarchy**: Clear separation between services and main navigation

## Mobile Navigation  
- **Touch activation**: Accordion expands on touch/click
- **Smooth animations**: CSS transitions for professional feel
- **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA labels and keyboard support

## Integration Pattern
The dropdown integrates seamlessly with existing navigation while replacing the flat services link, maintaining all other navigation functionality intact.
