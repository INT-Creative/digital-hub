â”œâ”€â”€ PortfolioFilter.astro        # Filter navigation with client-side enhancement

â””â”€â”€ [9 more case study pages...]

src/data/
â””â”€â”€ portfolio.ts                 # Comprehensive portfolio data structure
```

### Technical Fixes Implemented
1. **Portfolio Filtering Bug** - FIXED
   - **Issue**: Data structure mismatch between filter URLs and filtering logic
   - **Root Cause**: Filter function used `category` field but URLs used `serviceType` values
   - **Solution**: Updated filtering logic to use `serviceType` field consistently
   - **Result**: All 4 service categories now filter correctly

2. **Client-Side Enhancement** - ADDED
   - Progressive enhancement for smooth filtering without page reloads
   - Mobile-optimized dropdown with touch-friendly interactions
   - Browser history management with proper back/forward support
   - Graceful fallback to server-side filtering

### Legal Compliance Implementation
1. **Demonstration Disclaimers** - REQUIRED
   - Prominent amber warning banners on portfolio pages
   - Clear "Demonstration Project" labels on all portfolio cards
   - "Fictional testimonial" warnings for all testimonials
   - FTC-compliant disclosure language throughout

2. **Messaging Updates** - CRITICAL
   - Changed "Client Results Portfolio" â†’ "Demonstration Portfolio"
   - Updated "Real transformations" â†’ "Methodology demonstrations"
   - Added "(Fictional)" labels to all testimonials
   - Positioned transparency as business strength

npm run check
