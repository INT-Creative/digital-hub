# Facebook Ads for Local Service Businesses: $500 Budget, 23 New Customers

"Facebook ads don't work for my business. My customers aren't on social media."

I've heard this from dozens of Northeast Ohio service businesses. Then I show them the results from Mike's HVAC in Cleveland: 23 new customers from a $500 monthly ad spend. Average customer value: $2,800. Total revenue: $64,400.

ROI: 12,780%.

Here's exactly how we did it—and how you can replicate these results for your service business.

## The Client: Mike's Heating & Cooling (Cleveland, OH)

**Business Type**: Residential HVAC repair and replacement
**Service Area**: Cleveland and inner suburbs (15-mile radius)
**Previous Marketing**: Yellow Pages, door hangers, truck wraps
**Challenge**: Declining leads, aging customer base, high cost per acquisition

**Before Facebook Ads**:
- 15-20 leads per month
- $180 average cost per lead (mostly from Google Ads)
- 25% conversion rate
- Heavy seasonal fluctuations

**After 6 Months of Facebook Ads**:
- 45-60 leads per month
- $22 average cost per lead
- 51% conversion rate
- More consistent year-round business

## Why Facebook Works for Local Service Businesses

### Myth: "My customers aren't on Facebook"
**Reality**: 69% of US adults use Facebook, with heaviest usage in the 35-65 age range—your prime customer demographic.

### Myth: "Facebook is for B2C, not local services"
**Reality**: Facebook's local targeting is incredibly precise. We can target homeowners within 5 miles who have shown interest in home improvement, have household incomes above $50k, and are likely to need HVAC services.

### Myth: "People don't buy services from social media"
**Reality**: People don't buy directly, but they research and comparison shop. Facebook ads get you into the consideration set.

## The Strategy: Education + Emergency Response

Most HVAC companies advertise when people already need emergency service—competing on price in a crowded market. We flipped the script.

### Our Two-Pronged Approach:

**Prong 1**: Educational content targeting homeowners before they have problems
**Prong 2**: Emergency response ads for people actively searching for help

This created both immediate leads and long-term brand awareness.

## Campaign #1: "Homeowner Education Series" (70% of budget)

### Target Audience:
- Location: 15 miles around Cleveland
- Age: 35-65
- Homeowners (Facebook data)
- Household income: $40,000+
- Interests: Home improvement, energy efficiency, home maintenance

### Ad Creative Strategy:
Instead of "Call us for HVAC repair," we used education-first headlines:

**Winning Headlines**:
- "3 Signs Your Furnace Won't Make It Through Winter"
- "Why Your Electric Bill Doubled (And How to Fix It)"
- "Free Home Energy Audit: Find Hidden Money Wasters"
- "Cleveland Homeowners: Is Your HVAC System Killing Your Budget?"

### The Landing Page:
Simple, mobile-optimized page with:
- Educational content addressing the specific concern
- Free consultation offer
- Local credibility signals (Better Business Bureau, local references)
- Clear phone number and contact form

### Sample Ad Copy (Top Performer):

**Headline**: "3 Signs Your Furnace Won't Make It Through Winter"

**Body**: "Cleveland winters are tough on heating systems. Don't get caught with no heat when the next cold snap hits.

Watch for these warning signs:

## Campaign #2: "Emergency Response" (30% of budget)

### Target Audience:
- Location: 10 miles around Cleveland (tighter radius for emergencies)
- Age: 25-70

### Ad Creative Strategy:
Urgency and availability focused:

**Winning Headlines**:

- Life Stage: Empty nesters and growing families

**Geographic Patterns**:

### Custom Audiences That Scaled Results:

**1. Website Visitor Retargeting**:

## Scaling Challenges and Solutions

**Problem**: Cost per lead increased to $4.50

**Solution**: Shifted to AC maintenance and efficiency messaging, added indoor air quality focus

### Month 6+: Competition Response
**Problem**: Competitors started similar Facebook campaigns

## Creative Assets That Drove Results

## Common Mistakes That Kill Facebook Ad ROI

### Mistake #1: Generic Targeting
**Wrong**: "Adults 25-65 in Cleveland interested in home improvement"
**Right**: "Homeowners 35-55 in specific Cleveland zip codes, household income $40k+, likely to need HVAC service"

### Mistake #2: Company-Focused Headlines
**Wrong**: "Mike's HVAC - 20 Years of Experience"
**Right**: "3 Signs Your Furnace Won't Make It Through Winter"

### Mistake #3: No Mobile Optimization
**Wrong**: Desktop-focused landing pages and forms
**Right**: Mobile-first design with click-to-call prominently displayed

### Mistake #4: Immediate Sales Focus
**Wrong**: "Call Now for 50% Off System Replacement"
**Right**: "Free Home Energy Audit: Find Hidden Money Wasters"

### Mistake #5: Set and Forget
**Wrong**: Create ads and let them run for months without changes
**Right**: Daily monitoring, weekly optimizations, monthly creative refresh
